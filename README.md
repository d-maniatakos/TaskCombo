# TaskGroup
An Application for starting Multiple Tasks at Once

## The Idea

While doing different kinds of work on the computer,it's sometimes necessary to open more than one tasks or applications.For example,to do 
video editing,someone may need to start a video-editing software, an audio-editing software and a file explorer.With TaskGroup it's possible
to create many Sessions ( for example a Session for Video Editing,a Session for Office Work ,a session for Music Producing etc. ) with many 
tasks(like software) for each

# How to Use

After properly compiling and starting the excetuable file,use the command window to see the available options

For saving purposes,a .txt file named save_info.txt is created.When the user exits the application(using the appropriate command),all 
information are stored there.When the application is executed again,it reads all the previously saved information from this file.If this 
file is deleted,all saved data is lost

# Limitations

TaskGroup works ,currently,only in Windows.It's, also, in an initial form(no appropirate error handling or testing yet)
